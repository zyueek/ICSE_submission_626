Here is the data for ICSE submission paper An Empirical Study of Modeling Fault Localization as a Decision Making Process with Uncertainty and Ambiguity.\
All results are shown in four metrics, Exam score, Per5, Per10 and Per20.\
fusion_all is the random fusion in 9 SBFL with window size 1-9 on the whole defects4j.\
fusion_multi is the random fusion in 9 SBFL with window size 1-9 on the multiline defects4j.\
singleall is nine single SBFL with window size 0-9 on the whole defects4j.\
singlemulti is nine sinle SBFL with window size 0-9 on the multiline defects4j.
